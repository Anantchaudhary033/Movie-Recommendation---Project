# Movie-Recommendation system

# INTRODUCTION
Movie recommender systems are widely used to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences.To analyze text data related to movies and users by using machine learning algorithms to recommend movies to consumers.

# APPROACH

DATA COLLECTION
We collect movie data from various sources such as IMDb, TMDB, or other movie databases. The data includes information such as movie titles, genres, plots, and user ratings.

TEXT VECTORIZATION
Text vectorization is a crucial step in building a movie recommender system. It involves converting textual data into numerical vectors that can be used by machine learning algorithms. One common method used is cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, providing a measure of similarity between documents.
